# Free-mtrix

Free-mtrix is a software for scientists of fields like Behavioral Sociology and Behavioral Analysis. You can design and present social behavior experiments that uses choice-based tasks similiar to the ones created by Wiggins (1969), Vichi (2004) and Vichi, Andery & Glenn (2009). Participants can choose elements of a matrix (for instance, a row, a column or a cell) and the scientist can build social consequences (for example, messages, points and questions) for their choices.
