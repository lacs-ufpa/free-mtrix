# Free-mtrix

**Abstract**

Free-mtrix is free software (GPL3) for scientists of fields like Behavioral Sociology and Behavioral Analysis. You can design and present social behavior experiments that uses choice-based tasks similiar to the ones created by Wiggins (1969), Vichi (2004) and Vichi, Andery & Glenn (2009). Participants can choose elements of a matrix (e.g., a row) and the scientist can determine how individual and social consequences will be presented (e.g., which messages, how many points and reasoning questions).
