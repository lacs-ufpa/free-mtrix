No need for installation. Just run the executable.

- How to setup?

You have at least two options.

1. Running from different folders in a machine (default for debugging).
2. Running from different machines in a local network.

You will need an instance of the program acting as a Server (researcher) and others acting as Clients (players). Clients must connect to the IP address of the Server; just create a file called 'IP' in the root folder of each client containing the Server IP on the first line.
