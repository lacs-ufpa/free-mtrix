## How to setup?

   - You have at least two options.
      1. Running from different folders in one machine (default for debugging).
      2. Running from different machines in a local network.

   - If you have a firewall enabled, you must create a firewall rule adding the program as an exception.

   - You will need an instance of the program running as Server (researcher) and others running as Clients (players). You will need at least two clients.

   - Clients must connect to the IP address of the Server; just create a file named 'IP' in the root folder of each client containing the Server IP on the first line.

## Known Issues

**`A referral was returned from the server`**

   - Windows Only Error.
   - Solution 1: Right click at the `.exe` and select properties. In the tab compatibility, check the checkbox "Run as administrator".
